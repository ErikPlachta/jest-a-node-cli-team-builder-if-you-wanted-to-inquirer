## Concept Summary

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees
on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays
summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable,
you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes
all of them.

## Concept Goals

- :white_check_mark: **GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input**
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- :white_check_mark: WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
